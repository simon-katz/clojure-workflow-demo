# Clojure Workflow Demo

A sample project that uses Stuart Sierra's approach to having a
dynamic workflow for Clojure development.

See
[Stuart's blog post](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded)
for details of his approach.

See
[my blog post](http://blogish.nomistech.com/clojure/clojure-workflow-demo/)
for details of what's here, especially for a few minor differences
between what's here and what's described in Stuart's blog post.
